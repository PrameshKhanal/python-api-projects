## Introduction
### üöÄ API Fun Projects

Welcome to my API Fun Projects repository! Here, I create small Python projects using different public APIs. From creating your own public transportation information (using Digitransit API) to checking the weather, each project is a cool way to play with information available online.

### üîç Explore the Subfolders:
* Each subfolder has a different project, showing how to use APIs in Python.
* Check out the code to see how I make interesting things with data from various APIs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Learning and Trying Out:
* These projects are my way of learning and trying out new things with Python and APIs.
* See how to get, process, and show data from different APIs while improving your coding skills.

### üåü Get Involved:
* Explore, add your own touch, or share your ideas.
* I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas to make these projects even better.

### üöß Still Building:
* This repository is always changing as I add new projects. Keep an eye out for updates!
